# XRM Project Template CQS

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a clean solution template for building XRM (Dynamics CRM / Dynamics 365 CE) projects. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandâ€“query_separation" target="_blank">CQS (Command-Query-Seperation)</a> principle and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a> principles. The aim is to build the solution with small, testable, maintainable and non-conflicting (in sense of source control) blocks. At the same time the amount of non business logic related code should be minimized if not avoided completely.

As the name suggests the template enforces an CQS inspired coding style. There should be a clear separation between code that modifies state (Commands) and code that reads state (Queries). No single method (or in this case even class) should do both. Additionally having separate classes for handling each command results in small, single purpose, classes which are easy to maintain and test.

## Commands, events and queries

The program flow is created using 3 main building blocks:
1. Commands - telling the system to do something, for example "UpdateChildContactCount" command in the context of an Account. Each **command** should by design have exactly one **command handler**, which contains the implementation of handling the command.
2. Events - telling the system that something has happened, for example "ChildContactCountUpdated". Each **event** can have any number (0..N) subscribed **event handlers**, which contain the implementation of handling the event.
3. Queries - used to retrieve data from CRM

Commands and events depend on the queries (since often the decision what to do depends on data we need to retrieve). 

**Queries** depend only on CRM. Commands and events don't do any query data directly, instead they do it through the queries. **Commands**, when done, can raise events. **Events**, when done, can raise events. The image below depicts their interactions.

## How does it work?

Let's assume we want to implement a flow like this: Whenever a contact is created or updated it's parent accounts name should be updated to reflect how many child contacts it has - something like "I have {N} contacts". After this is done, the contacts last name should be updated to something like "My parent account has {N} contacts". Then after this is done a not should be created on the contact with text like "I am a note".

The solution involves a new component, that has previously not been mentioned - the command and event **bus**. Without going into details - it's something that's responsible for executing command handlers for commands and event handlers for events. Additionally it takes care of injecting all required dependencies.

The flow described above should look something like this:

```
SetAccountNrOfContactsCommand
   -> ChildContactsInNameSetEvent
       -> ParentAccountChildContactCountSetInLastNameEvent
```

Because the trigger will be an create or update of a Contact and part of the flow touches the same contact that triggered the flow, we'll implement it using 2 pre-operation plugins: ContactPreCreate and ContactPreUpdate.

We start by defining the **Command** the plugins will be issuing. This can be something like:
```
public class SetAccountNrOfContactsCommand : ICommand
{
    public Contact FromContact { get; set; }
}
```

This is just a simple POCO class, implementing an empty ```ICommand``` interface.

Next let's create our two plugins:

```csharp
public class ContactPreCreate : Base.Plugin
{
    public ContactPreCreate() : base(typeof(ContactPreCreate))
    {
        RegisterPluginStep<Ctx.Contact>(EventOperation.Create, ExecutionStage.PreOperation, Execute);
    }

    private void Execute(LocalPluginContext localContext)
    {
        Ctx.Contact targetContact = localContext.GetTarget<Ctx.Contact>();

        var setAccountNrOfContactsCommand = new SetAccountNrOfContactsCommand
        {
            FromContact = targetContact
        };
        CommandBus.Handle(setAccountNrOfContactsCommand);
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class ContactPreUpdate : Base.Plugin
{
    public ContactPreUpdate() : base(typeof(ContactPreUpdate))
    {
        RegisterPluginStep<Ctx.Contact>(EventOperation.Update, ExecutionStage.PreOperation, Execute);
    }

    private void Execute(LocalPluginContext localContext)
    {
        Ctx.Contact targetContact = localContext.GetTarget<Ctx.Contact>();

        var setAccountNrOfContactsCommand = new SetAccountNrOfContactsCommand
        {
            FromContact = targetContact
        };
        CommandBus.Handle(setAccountNrOfContactsCommand);
    }
}
```

If you don't recognize the above code, this is because the **XRM Project Template** uses a slightly customized version of the <a href="https://github.com/delegateas/Daxif/" target="_blank">Delegate DAXIF#</a> framework. The main feature we utilize here is automatic plugin registration, based on metadata in the code itself - the ```RegisterPluginStep``` method. Also all the things you would normally expect in the plugin, like obtaining the CRM's ``IOrganizationService`` reference, ``ITracingService`` and ``IPluginExecutionContext`` are already handled in the ```Base.Plugin```. This follows the philosophy, explained on top of this page, of avoiding any unnecessary filler code and focusing only on what is absolutely required. 

All this plugin does is setup a simple **Command** a  and pass it over to the **Command bus**, which will try to find a suitable **Command handler** and execute it.

Let's leave the **Command bus** implementation a black box. Ideally you will never need to touch it (except for maybe adding new dependencies into the DI Container - described later). Right now we have a **Command** so we need an corresponding **Command handler**. But we can also foresee it will need some way to get the number of child contacts of a certain account. So let's start by creating a query:

```csharp
public class AccountQueries : CrmQuery<Account>
{
    public AccountQueries(IOrganizationService orgService) : base(orgService) { }

    public int GetNrOfContacts(Guid accountId)
    {
        using (XrmContext xrm = new XrmContext(OrgService))
        {
            return xrm.ContactSet
                      .Where(c => c.ParentCustomerId != null && c.ParentCustomerId.Id == accountId)
                      .Select(c => c.Id)
                      .ToArray()
                      .Length;
        }
    }
}
```

Any **Query** should be a class extending the abstract ```CrmQuery<TEntity>``` class. The command bus will automatically set any constructor injected dependencies. In this case we only need a reference to the ```IOrganizationService```. Next we just implement the query method we need, in this case ```GetNrOfContacts```.

Having the required query, we can implement the **Command handler**:

```csharp
public class SetAccountNrOfContactsCommandHandler : CommandHandler<SetAccountNrOfContactsCommand, AccountNrOfContactsSetEvent>
{
    private readonly AccountQueries accountQueries;

    public SetAccountNrOfContactsCommandHandler(IOrganizationServiceWrapper orgServiceWrapper, IEventBus eventBus,
        AccountQueries accountQueries)
        : base(orgServiceWrapper, eventBus)
    {
        this.accountQueries = accountQueries ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(accountQueries));
    }

    public override AccountNrOfContactsSetEvent Execute(SetAccountNrOfContactsCommand command)
    {
        command.FromContact = command.FromContact ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(command.FromContact));

        if (command.FromContact.ParentCustomerId == null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        int nrOfContacts = accountQueries.GetNrOfContacts(command.FromContact.ParentCustomerId.Id);

        Account account = new Account
        {
            Id = command.FromContact.ParentCustomerId.Id,
            Name = $"I have {nrOfContacts} contacts"
        };
        orgServiceWrapper.OrgServiceAsSystem.Update(account);

        return new AccountNrOfContactsSetEvent { TargetContact = command.FromContact };
    }
}
```
